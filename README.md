# IT Security Solution

## Overview
The IT Security Solution is a comprehensive security framework designed to monitor, protect, and manage IT systems. This solution includes a remote agent and a central server, primarily targeting Windows systems, with future plans for Linux and macOS support.

## Objectives
- **System Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system health, including CPU, RAM, disk usage, and running services.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identify vulnerabilities through software inventory, configuration scanning, and CVE correlation.
- **Antivirus Protection**: Provide signature-based antivirus scanning, real-time protection, and scheduled scanning.
- **Patch Management**: Detect and deploy patches for operating systems and software.
- **Remote Access**: Enable secure remote shell access and remote desktop capabilities.

## System Architecture
The solution consists of two main components:

### Client Endpoint (Agent)
- **Agent Core**: The main component that integrates various functionalities.
- **System Monitor**: Monitors system resources and services.
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Scans for vulnerabilities and correlates with known CVEs.
- **Antivirus Scanner**: Provides antivirus functionalities.
- **Remote Shell**: Allows command execution via PowerShell, CMD, and Bash.
- **Remote Desktop**: Facilitates screen streaming and user consent for remote access.

### Central Server
- **API Server**: Manages secure communications between agents and the server.
- **Dashboard UI**: Provides an admin interface for monitoring and management.
- **Command Dispatcher**: Handles requests and tasks from agents.
- **Patch Management Orchestrator**: Manages patch detection and deployment.
- **Log/Audit Storage**: Stores logs for actions, scans, and sessions.

## Tech Stack
- **Agent Core**: C# (.NET Core)
- **Remote Shell**: C# + WebSockets
- **Remote Desktop**: C++/Rust
- **Vulnerability & AV Engines**: Python modules
- **API Server**: Node.js
- **Dashboard UI**: React.js
- **Relay Server**: Node.js (WebRTC or TCP relay)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis

## Future Enhancements
- Support for Linux/macOS agents.
- REST API for third-party integrations.
- Enhanced alerting systems (Email, Slack, Webhook).
- Encryption at rest for agent data storage.
- Multi-tenant support for enterprise deployments.

## Getting Started
To set up the IT Security Solution, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `agent` and `central-server` directories to build and run the respective components.
3. Configure the central server and agent settings as per your environment.

# Redis Database Setup

This directory contains the documentation for setting up and using Redis as part of the IT security solution.

## Overview

Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. In this project, Redis will be utilized for caching purposes to enhance the performance of the application.

## Installation

To install Redis, follow the instructions for your operating system:

### For Windows

  ```
  SET key value
  ```

- Get a key:
  ```
  GET key
  ```

## Integration with IT Security Solution

In this project, Redis will be used to cache frequently accessed data, improving the overall performance of the IT security solution. Ensure that your application is configured to connect to the Redis server using the appropriate connection settings.

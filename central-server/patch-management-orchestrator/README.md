# Patch Management Orchestrator

The Patch Management Orchestrator is a key component of the IT security solution, responsible for detecting and deploying patches for both operating systems and software applications. This module ensures that all endpoints are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing overall system security.

## Features

- **Patch Detection**: Automatically identifies available patches for installed software and operating systems.
- **Patch Deployment**: Facilitates the deployment of patches to client endpoints, ensuring timely updates.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports on patch status, including successful deployments and any errors encountered.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with the central server's API and command dispatcher for efficient communication and task management.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that all required dependencies are installed. Refer to the `package.json` file for a complete list.
2. **Configuration**: Configure the orchestrator settings as needed, including any specific patch sources or deployment schedules.
3. **Run the Orchestrator**: Start the orchestrator service to begin monitoring for patches and managing deployments.

## Usage

- The orchestrator will automatically check for patches at defined intervals.
- Administrators can manually trigger patch scans and deployments through the central server's dashboard.
- Review the generated reports to monitor the patching status across all endpoints.

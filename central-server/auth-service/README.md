# Auth Service Documentation

## Overview
The Auth Service is a critical component of the IT security solution, responsible for managing role-based access control and session management. It ensures that only authorized users can access the system and perform actions based on their assigned roles.

## Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manages user roles and permissions to restrict access to various functionalities within the system.
- **Session Management**: Handles user sessions securely, including session creation, validation, and expiration.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `auth-service` directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Update the configuration settings in `src/auth.js` as needed to connect to your database and set up authentication parameters.

3. **Start the Service**: To start the Auth Service, run:
   ```
   node src/auth.js
   ```

## Usage
- The Auth Service exposes endpoints for user authentication and role management. Refer to the API documentation for details on available endpoints and their usage.

## Development
- The service is built using Node.js. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine to run and develop the service.

## Testing
- Implement unit tests to verify the functionality of the Auth Service. Use a testing framework of your choice.

## Future Enhancements
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for added security.
- Explore integration with third-party identity providers for user authentication.

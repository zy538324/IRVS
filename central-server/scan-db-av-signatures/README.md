# Scan DB and AV Signatures Module

This module is responsible for managing the database of vulnerabilities and antivirus signatures. It includes functionalities for storing, retrieving, and updating vulnerability data and antivirus definitions to ensure the security solution is up-to-date and effective.

## Directory Structure

- **migrations/**: This directory contains database migration files that define the schema changes for the Scan DB and AV Signatures module.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure that the PostgreSQL database is set up and running.
2. Apply the migrations located in the `migrations/` directory to create the necessary tables and structures in the database.
3. Integrate this module with the central server's API to enable communication and data exchange.

## Usage

This module will be used by the central server to perform vulnerability scanning and antivirus signature checks. It is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the systems being monitored.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement automated updates for antivirus signatures.
- Enhance vulnerability correlation with external databases for real-time threat intelligence.

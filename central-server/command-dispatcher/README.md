# Command Dispatcher Module

The Command Dispatcher is a crucial component of the IT security solution's central server. It is responsible for handling requests and tasks from the remote agents, ensuring efficient communication and execution of commands.

## Overview

The Command Dispatcher interacts with the API Server to receive commands and forwards them to the appropriate agent endpoints. It plays a vital role in managing the flow of information between the central server and the client endpoints.

## Features

- **Agent Communication**: Facilitates secure communication with remote agents.
- **Task Management**: Dispatches commands and tasks to agents based on requests.
- **Real-time Processing**: Handles requests in real-time to ensure timely execution of commands.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that all required dependencies are installed. You can do this by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration**: Configure the necessary environment variables for secure communication and agent management.

3. **Start the Dispatcher**: Launch the Command Dispatcher using:
   ```
   node src/dispatcher.js
   ```

## Usage

Once the Command Dispatcher is running, it will listen for incoming requests from the API Server and manage the communication with the agents accordingly. Ensure that the agents are properly configured to communicate with the Command Dispatcher.
